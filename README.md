# Buildspace Mint NFT Collection

Description of project from [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/):

"You know those websites where people are making millions of dollars where users can come and 'mint' an NFT? We're building that.
Your project will let users connect their Ethereum wallet, and mint an NFT to their wallet so they actually own it. They'll even be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea. The NFT itself can be customized to whatever you want."

I am creating a Star Wars themed NFT called FalconNFT, where each NFT is a uniquely generated combination of possible ship names.

## Commands

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
